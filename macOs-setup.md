Extensions:
- [Maccy](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/maccy) (clipboard manager with searchable history )
- [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) ( better ways to snap windows to half, 2/3 of screen etc etc. Handy with ultrawide displays). The `Almost Maximize` is used to do the center 2/3
  ```bash
  defaults write com.knollsoft.Rectangle almostMaximizeWidth -float 0.7
  defaults write com.knollsoft.Rectangle almostMaximizeHeight -float 0.97
  ```
- [AltTab](https://alt-tab-macos.netlify.app/) (change the altTab behavior to show previous of the open apps instead of icons only)
  ```bash
  set 3 shortcuts:
  1- option tab for all apps
  2- option `  for active app
  3- option ยง for active app (at least for the weird danish-international keyboard, we want the key on the left on the number 1 in the laptop keyboard
  ```
- [SpaceId](https://github.com/dshnkao/SpaceId) (show the number of the current active workspace)
- [Dozer](https://github.com/Mortennn/Dozer) (hide some of the unused items in the top bar)
- NeuHoner (draw borders around active window, flaky support lately)
