It turns out that some keyboard shortcuts in Gnome do not show up in Settings → Devices → Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts. These "hidden" shortcuts are accessible by using the dconf-editor command. In the dconf editor, the Super+1 remapping was found at

org/gnome/shell/keybindings/switch-to-application-1

while remappings for Super+2, Super+3, etc. were found at similar locations. By clearing these mappings I was able to redefine my own.
